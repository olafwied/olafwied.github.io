## Announcing new online course on Advanced Bayesian ML!

I have started compiling material for my upcoming online course on "Scalable Methods for Bayesian Machine Learning and Probabilistic Inference".

You can find a preview of the course presentation at olafwied.github.io/AdvBayes-Course (under construction). The presentation uses reveal.js. To navigate through the presentation press the `right` and `left` arrow buttons to jump from one section to the next. Use the `up` and `down` arrows to go through the material for each section. Hit `Esc` to see an overview of the slide layout.

I'm planning to present the following topics over five parts (subject to change):

### Part I - Short Recap of Bayesian Basics
- Bayes Theorem
- Bayesian Inference
- Generative vs Discriminative Models
- Bayesian Statistics
- Priors
- Frequentist Statistics

### Part II - Latent Variable Models and the EM Algorithm
- Kullback-Leibler Divergence
- Latent Variable Models
- Example: Mixture Models
- EM Algorithm, E-Step and M-Step
- Large Scale EM
- (Stochastic) Variational Inference

### Part III - Scalable Methods for Bayesian Learning
- Probabilistic PCA
- Variational Autoencoders
- The Reparametrization Trick
- Generative Models and Adverserial Learning

### Part IV - Gaussian Processes and Optimization
- Gaussian Processes
- Bayesian Optimization
- MCMC

### Part V - Bayesian Deep Learning
- Bayesian Neural Networks
- Variational Dropout
- Sparse Bayesian Networks

For now, I'm working on putting the content together. Eventually, I will record lectures covering everything in more detail. Stay tuned.
