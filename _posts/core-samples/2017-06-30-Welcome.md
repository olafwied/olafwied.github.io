##Welcome to YARDS
###Yet Another Resource on Data Science

First of all, thank you for your interest in this site. Feel free to leave comments or contact me about any posts or other questions related to data science. 

This blog will eventually develop into a collection of important theoretical and sometimes practical concepts of data science and machine learning. I mostly adopt a probabilistic (Bayesian) perspective and try to present ideas in a concise framework wherever possible. Once in a while, I will throw in some stories and tips on how to implement these concepts from a practical and professional perspective.

Everything is still in the early stages. So, you might want to check back in at a later time.
