## Announcing new, free online course on Advanced Bayesian ML!

I started compiling material for my upcoming (free!) online course on Scalable Methods for Bayesian Machine Learning and Probabilistic Inference".

You can find the course presentation at olafwied.github.io/AdvBayes-Course. The presentation uses reveal.js. To navigate through the presentation presse the `right` and `left` arrow buttons to jump from one section to the next. Use the `up` and `down` arrows to go through the material for each section. Hit `Esc` to see an overview of the slide layout.

I'm planning to present the following topics over five parts:

### Part I - Short Recap of Bayesian Basics
- Bayes Theorem
- Bayesian Inference
- Generative vs Discriminative Models
- Bayesian Statistics
- Priors
- Frequentist Statistics

### Part II - Latent Variable Models and the EM Algorithm

### Part III - Scalable Methods for Bayesian Learning
- Probabilistic PCA
- Variational Autoencoders
- The Reparametrization Trick
- Generative Models and Adverserial Learning

### Part IV - Gaussian Processes and Optimization
- Gaussian Processes
- Bayesian Optimization
- MCMC

### Part V - Bayesian Deep Learning
- Bayesian Neural Networks
- Variational Dropout
- Sparse Bayesian Networks

For now, I'm working on putting the content together. Eventually, I will record lectures covering everything in more detail. Stay tuned.
